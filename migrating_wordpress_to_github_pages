 Migrating from Wordpress to GitHub Pages
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 GitHub Pages runs on top of the GitHub platform and is powered by Jekyll, 
 a templating engine that translates Markdown to static HTML.


Step 1:
-------
    Create a GitHub repository named  <username>.github.io .
    Clone the repository to your computer:
    
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io.git



Step 2:
-------
    Install Ruby:
 sudo apt-get install ruby-full
 ruby -v   --> to check the version
 
 
    Install the following gems for Ruby:
     - Bundler
     - Jekyll (latest supported versions -> https://pages.github.com/versions/ )
sudo gem install bundler
sudo gem install jekyll -v 3.9.0

    
    Now create your Jekyll site with Bundler:
bundle init
bundle add jekyll -v 3.9.0 --skip-install
bundle exec jekyll new --force --skip-bundle .


    Jekyll allows you to run your site locally, which comes in very handy if 
    you need to check how your posts look before making them public:
bundle install
bundle exec jekyll serve

    Go to http://localhost:4000 .


    You can customize the site’s title, contact information, and social media
    links by updating the corresponding properties on the _config.yml YAML file.
    Add the following property show an excerpt of my posts on the home page:
show_excerpts: true
    And changed the default post URLs to only include the title:
permalink: /:title/

    Some of this configuration parameters are theme specific. Check out the default
    theme for a full list of available settings.




Step 3:
-------
     Exporting Workdpress Posts 
     https://www.deadlyfingers.net/code/migrating-from-wordpress-to-github-pages
     
     Log into you Wordpress admin console and go to the following URL:
     https://your-domain/wp-admin/export.php
     
     Select 'All Content' and download. The export file is in XML format and 
     contains references to images and other assets. 
     Use the jekyll-import Ruby gem to convert the exported files into HTML and
     download all images to the assets directory.

     Install the following Gems:
sudo gem install jekyll-import
sudo gem install hpricot
sudo gem install open_uri_redirections
sudo gem install reverse_markdown
     
     Run this command:
ruby -r rubygems -e 'require "jekyll-import";
    JekyllImport::Importers::Blogger.run({
      "source" => "/path/to/blog-MM-DD-YYYY.xml",
  "no_fetch_images" => false,
  "assets_folder" => "assets/images"
})'
 
 
     Lastly, use the following Ruby script
     (https://gist.github.com/deadlyfingers/2023c61cbac83bb613393f262693cdf4) 
     to convert the HTML content to Markdown:
ruby ./wordpress-html-to-md.rb "_posts"
     
     All you have to do now is copy the entire assets folder to the root of your 
     Jekyll project and move all the .md files generate by the scrip from the _posts
     folder into the _posts folder of your Jekyll’s site.

     Re-run you site locally and verify that all your posts are being listed on the
     home page.
     
     
     Now you can start customizing your site to your own needs. However, here are
     a couple of things you might want to do to “clean up” your posts. If you open
     one of the Markdown files you’ll see a bunch of metadata fields at the top of
     the page. The following fields are not needed and can be removed from all your 
     posts:
            type
            parent_id
            published
            password
            status
            meta
            author
            
     In addition, some posts might contain absolute URLs referencing other posts. 
     Absolute URLs are discouraged since they make your site less portable. Run the
     following sed command to replace absolute URLs with relative URLs. 
     Replace <your-domain> with the domain for your site:
     
sed -i.bak 's/https:\/\/<your-domain>//g' *.md

Run your site locally
----------------------

bundle exec jekyll serve
    Go to http://localhost:4000 .
    
    To stop it:
kill -9 $(lsof -t -i:4000)

    


Step 1: Install Jekyll Export
        Jekyll Export is a WordPress plugin built by Ben Balter.
        Install this plugin and run it. Everything will be exported and
        downloaded as export.zip.

Step 2: Unzip and serve using Jekyll


        For linux:
unzip jekyll-export.zip 
        If there is a problem, try:
jar xvf jekyll-export.zip 


        Unzip the downloaded zip folder. It should have all the necessary
        files like _posts,    _config.yml, index.html, wp-content etc.

        We need only _posts, wp-content and other required HTML pages. 
        Move these folders to a Jekyll theme. Test it locally. If everything
        works then upload the site to a repository on Github Pages.
