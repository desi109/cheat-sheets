React Router
------------
It is a library for managing navigation and routing in React applications. It allows you to define routes, navigate
between them, and render components based on the current URL. React Router is not part from the React core library, so
it needs to be installed:

   npm install react-router@latest

For the routing we can also use context API, but React Router is more powerful and easier to use for most cases.
In App.jsx, three components from the react-router library are imported:

     import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router';

 * BrowserRouter: It has the basic router functionality and it is used as a parent.
 * Route: It acts as a container dor the individual route components.
 * Route: It consists of a path (which is a relative URL) and JSX to render when the path in the address bar of the
          browser matches.
 * index: Index means the root of the domain (the homa page).

Example:
---------> App.jsx
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router';

function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Banner>
        <div>Providing a banner for the application</div>
      </Banner>
      <Routes>
        <Route index path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" component={About} />
        <Route path="/contact" component={Contact} />
      </Routes>
    <BrowserRouter>
  );
}

export default App;
```
