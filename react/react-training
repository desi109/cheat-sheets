React Training
---------------

Day 1: Intro to React and JSX
------------------------------
1. What is React?
2. What is SPA?
3. React - installation and set up
4. JSX syntax / JSX vs HTML
Task: Create your first "Hello World" React app


Day 2: React Components and Props
----------------------------------
1. Components
2. Component hierarchy
3. Props and how to pass data
4. Styling components
Task: Update Day 1 task to pass the name field and render "Hello, {name}!" instead of "Hello World".


Day 3: State and Events
------------------------
1. What is state?
2. useState hook
3. Handling events
4. Conditional rendering
5. Rendering lists and using keys in lists
Task: Create a tic-tac-toe.


Day 4: Side effects and useEffect
----------------------------------
1. Side effects
2. useEffect hook
3. Fetching data from API
4. Listen to events
Task: Render the list of users (fetch it from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users API) in simple HTML table.


Day 5: Component composition and communication
------------------------------------------------
1. Component rendering
2. Component composition
3. Children
4. Parent-child communication
5. Child-parent communication
Task: Pass information from parent to child and child to parent components respectively.


Day 6: Forms and useRef
------------------------
1. Handling forms inputs
2. Controlled and uncontrolled inputs
3. useRef hook
Task: Create a simple form with controlled inputs and submit button. On submit, display the input values below the form.


Day 7: Router
---------------
1. Navigation
2. URL params, search params
3. Setting up React router
4. Route, link, useParams
Task: Create a simple multi-page React application using React Router to navigate between different components like
      Home, About, Contact.


Day 8: State Management and Context API
----------------------------------------
1. Global vs Local state
2. Context API: create, provide, consume-context
3. Context vs props
4. State management pattern
5. useReducer hook and complex state
Task: Create a small React application that allows users to toggle between light and dark themes.
      Use the Context API to mange the theme state globally and apply the selected theme across all components.


Day 9: Custom Hooks and Higher Order Component (HOC)
----------------------------------------------------
1. What is custom hook?
2. Patterns for extracting logic
3. What is Higher Order Component (HOC)?
4. React Portals
Task: Create a React app that display a counter increment and decrement buttons. Use a custom hook to manage the
      counter logic (state and handlers), and wrap the counter component with a Higher Order Component (HOC) that logs
      every time the component renders or the counter value changes.


Day 10: Performance and memoization
------------------------------------
1. React.memo
2. useMemo
3. useCallback
4. Optimization techniques
5. Code splitting
6. Testing
Task: Create a small calculate r that perform basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide).
      Use:
          - useMemo to memoize the results of calculations so it only recalculates when input changes.
          - useCallback to memoize the event handlers for input changes and button clicks.
      Unit tests to test:
          - Correctness of the calculations.
          - That the memoization works as expected (e.g., handlers and results don't recompute unnecessarily).
          - UI behavior (e.g., result updates when inputs change).
