How dockerize an application
=============================

What is Docker and why to use it?
---------------------------------
 - Docker is a container technology -  a tool for creating and managing conatiners.
 - A conatiner is a standardized unit of software or in other words, a package of code and 
   dependancies to run that code (e.g.: NodeJS code + NodeJS runtime)
 - The advantage is that the same container always will give you the exact same application and 
   execution behavior!n No matter where or by whom it might be executed.
   
   
Dockerizing is the process of packing, deploying, and running applications using Docker containers.
Docker is an open source tool that ships your application with all the necessary functionalities as
one package. You can use Docker to pack your application with everything you need to run the
application (such as libraries) and ship it as one package - a container. Containers are created
from images that specify their precise contents. Dockerizing is a big hit nowadays. All the big
names use it - Google, VMware, or Amazon support it.


1. Install docker:   https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/
---------------------------------------------------------

    
    * For Linux (Ubuntu): https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/
    - install Docker Engine only:  https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/
 sudo apt-get update
 sudo apt-get install \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg \
    lsb-release
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings
curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo gp
echo \
  "deb [arch=$(dpkg --print-architecture) signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/docker.gpg] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
  $(lsb_release -cs) stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/docker.list > /dev/null  
  
  


    !!!! See the STEM REQUIREMENTS fot the other two !!!!
    - intall Docker Toolbox if the requirements in the Docker site are NOT met
    - intall Docker Desktop if the requirements in the Docker site are met
   
    * For Windows:  https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
    * For macOS:  https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/

  
    Check if Docker is installed properly:
docker -v


     Note: If you can't install Docker on your system, you can also look into this online playground:

2. Creating the Dockerfile:
----------------------------


3. Containerize your application:
----------------------------------

4. Push the docker image to a docker repository(Dockerhub):
-----------------------------------------------------------

5. Pull the image and run it a ec2 instance:
---------------------------------------------
