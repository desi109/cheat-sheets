docker build .  ➔ Build a Dockerfile and create your own image based on the file
                ➔ -t NAME:TAG ➔ Assign a NAME and a TAG to an image
                
docker run IMAGE_NAME ➔ Create and start a new container based on image IMAGENAME (or use the image id)
                      ➔ --name NAME ➔ Assign a NAME to the container. The name can be used for stopping and removing etc.
                      ➔ -d ➔ Run the container in detached mode - i.e. output printed by the container is not visible, the
                             command prompt/terminal does NOT wait for the container to stop. 
                             Detached mode, shown by the option --detach or -d, means that a Docker container runs in the 
                             background of your terminal. It does not receive input or display output.
                      ➔ -it ➔ Run the container in "interactive" mode - the container/application is then prepared to receive
                              input via the command prompt/terminal. You can stop the container with CTRL + C when using the -it flag
                      ➔ --rm ➔ Automatically remove the container when it's stopped
                      
docker ps ➔ List all running containers
          ➔ -a ➔ List all containers - including stopped ones
          
docker images ➔ List all locally stored images
docker rm CONTAINER ➔ Remove a container with name CONTAINER (you can also use the container id)
docker rmi IMAGE ➔ Remove an image by name/id
docker container prune ➔ Remove all stopped containers

docker image prune ➔ Remove all dangling images (untagged images)
                   ➔ -a ➔ Remove all locally stored images
                   
docker push IMAGE ➔ Push an image to DockerHub (or another registry) - the image name/tag must include the repository name/url
docker pull IMAGE ➔ Pull (download) an image from DockerHub (or another registry) - this is done automatically if you just docker
                    run IMAGE and the image wasn't pulled before
