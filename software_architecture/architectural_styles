    Software Architechture   -->    Architectural Styles
   -------------------------      ========================

• Architectural patterns define the implementation strategies of those components and 
connectors (‘how?’) - More domain specific.
• Architectural styles define the components and connectors (‘what?’) - Less domain specific.


 
   ♦  Architectural Styles:
-------------------------------
• Pipe and Filter: https://syedhasan010.medium.com/pipe-and-filter-architecture-bd7babdb908
                   Examples: The architectural pattern is very popular and used in many 
                   systems, such as the text-based utilities in the UNIX operating system. 
                   Whenever different data sets need to be manipulated in different ways, 
                   you should consider using the pipe and filter architecture.
